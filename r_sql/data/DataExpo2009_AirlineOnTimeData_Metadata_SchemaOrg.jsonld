All of the papers presented in this Poster Session are reports of analyses of a common data set provided for the occasion. In addition, all papers presented in the session are encouraged to report the use of graphical methods employed during the developme nt of their analysis and to use graphics to convey their findings. Airline on-time performance: Have you ever been stuck in an airport because your flight was delayed or cancelled and wondered if you could have predicted it if you'd had more data? This is your chance to find out. The data: The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total, and takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space compressed and 12 gigab ytes when uncompressed. The data comes originally from RITA where it is described in detail. You can download the data there, or from the bzipped csv files listed below. These files have derivable variables removed, are packaged in yearly chunks and have been more heavily compressed than the originals.
